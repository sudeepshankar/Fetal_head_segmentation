<h1><strong>Fetal Head Image Segmentation</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>
<p>
    This project focuses on semantic segmentation of fetal head images using the UNet and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architectures. The goal is to accurately delineate the fetal head in medical images. The Dice score is employed as a metric to compare the performance of both architectures.
</p>

<h2><strong>Libraries Used</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>PyTorch</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Architectures</strong></h2>
<p>
    Two architectures were implemented for image segmentation:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>UNet:</strong> A convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>CNN:</strong> A Convolutional Neural Network architecture tailored for the specific requirements of fetal head segmentation.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h2><strong>Evaluation Metric</strong></h2>
<p>
    The Dice score is used as an evaluation metric to measure the similarity between the predicted and ground truth segmentations. It provides a quantitative assessment of the segmentation accuracy.
</p>

<h2><strong>Results and Comparisons</strong></h2>
<p>
    The project results, including the Dice scores and visual comparisons between UNet and CNN segmentations, can be found in the project documentation. To replicate the experiment or explore the results, refer to the code and notebooks provided.
</p>

<h2><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
<p>
    To view and interact with this project, open the Jupyter Notebook or related software containing the code and results. You can follow the code and analysis presented in the notebook to gain insights into the fetal head image segmentation task.
